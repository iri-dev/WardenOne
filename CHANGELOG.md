# Changelog

## 1.0.0 — 2026-07-29

First public-release hardening pass.

### Fixed

- Added bounded Twitch playback recovery for network/decode failures so ad
  interception fails open instead of leaving error 2000/3000, a black player,
  or a reload loop.
- Preserved Twitch low-latency HLS semantics and native playback requests while
  keeping confirmed ad-segment handling local to the browser.
- Split the popup guard from the full page engine so embedded players receive a
  small all-frame popup defence without the invasive top-frame feature bundle.
- Made the strict ad-popup shield the fresh-install default, while keeping
  explicit user opt-outs and login/OAuth flows intact.
- Prevented overlay cleanup, tracker learning, and network scriptlets from
  treating player frames, controls, or shared streaming infrastructure as ads.
- Made Verify & Repair follow the same frame boundaries as the manifest.
- Added a general player-safe mode for watch/embed routes: cosmetic rules,
  procedural removals, and every list-driven scriptlet now fail open while the
  dedicated popup guard stays active.
- Added failure-driven Smart Script Shield recovery for streaming players:
  after a fresh trusted player interaction, the failed script host family is
  retried under a tab-local replacement rule. If a second correlated failure
  survives that retry after a new player interaction, a bounded exact-script-path
  and initiator-scoped exception is used below site-control and security priority.
- Added bounded player detection for Video.js, JW Player, Plyr, Shaka, Clappr,
  DPlayer, and ArtPlayer, including delayed and single-page-app player startup.
- Made blocked player popups return a short-lived, non-navigable compatibility
  handle so ad-gated embeds continue loading instead of freezing on a spinner.
- Neutralized cross-site popup links layered over a player and preserved the
  underlying play/server-control activation.
- Kept hidden-autoplay protection away from media inside recognized player
  shells so zero-size initialization no longer pauses legitimate video.
- Fixed mixed-action consent dialogs so an unrelated account control no longer
  suppresses an otherwise explicit reject-all / accept-all choice.
- Refined sensitive-request detection so opaque verification responses and
  ordinary request identifiers remain functional while stored tokens, JWTs,
  credential-labelled fields, and authorization headers stay protected.
- Quieted behavioral and fingerprint notices only while a structurally visible
  browser-verification challenge is present; request protections remain active.

### Quality

- Added popup, streaming, Twitch fail-open, network-policy, and compatibility
  regressions to the maintainability suite.
- Corrected and expanded third-party licensing and attribution notes.
